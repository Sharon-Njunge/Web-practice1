    <h1 style="color: darkmagenta;">Babyl mobile app in Rwanda</h1>
    <p>This is a mobile app that triages healthcare delivering artificial intelligence.<br>It was born of the need to increase access to healthcare services, decrease the congestion of facilities and drive equity in Rwanda by providing digital care throught the country. </p>
    <h2>The implementation journey.</h2>
    <p>-It was first launched in 2014 where the Babylon company partnered with the Rwanda heathcare system and with the universal health coverage.<br>-A large number of the population is covered by the universal health coverage thus they only pay a small amount for the services.<br>-Babyl app does not need internet to be acessed because while they realized a large population cannot acess it thus USSD is used for the operations.<br>-They partnered with other health facilities acrooss the country to make it accesible to the citizens.<br>-There was training for more healthcare workers which included the community healthcare workers which are able to reach out to those who are unable to go to hospital for instance the elderly.</p>
